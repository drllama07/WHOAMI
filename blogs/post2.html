            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>We will explore and go through some of the computer vision topics like object detection that rely on deep learning models.</p>

            <h2>Object Detection with Yolov3</h2>
            <p>This is just a small part of any complete YOLOv3 implementation. If you're interested in seeing the full TensorFlow 2 implementation, feel free to check out my work on Kaggle:</p>

                <h3>1. IOU</h3>
                <p>IOU( intersection over union) is a common function used to calculate the ratio of intersection and the total union of two boxes.</p>
                <pre>

                        truex1y1 = cells + xy - wh/2.
                        truex2y2 = cells + xy + wh/2.

                        pred_area = (y_pred[..., 2] - y_pred[..., 0]) * (y_pred[..., 3] - y_pred[..., 1])
                        
                        # Calculate union area

                        # Calculate IoU loss (1 - IoU)

                <h3>3. YOLO Loss</h3>
                <p>The YOLO loss is the heart of the model—it's what the network aims to minimize during training, helping it become better at detecting objects. This loss function is a combination of several components that ensure precise object detection.</p>
                <p>One key part of this is the <strong>WH Loss</strong>, which focuses specifically on the width and height of the predicted bounding boxes. It ensures that the size of the predicted boxes matches as closely as possible with the actual objects, so we don't end up with bounding boxes that are too big or too small.</p>
                <p>The better the model gets at minimizing this loss, the more accurately it can identify objects in an image with the right-sized boxes.</p>
                    <pre>
                    <code>
                        # Calculate the true width and height using the logarithm
                        true_wh = tf.math.log(bbox_wh / anchors)  # Refer to the original paper for details.
                        
                        # Extract the predicted width and height from the model's output
                        pred_wh = pred_box[..., 2:4]
                        
                        # Calculate the loss by summing the squared differences
                        tf.reduce_sum(tf.square(true_wh - pred_wh), axis=-1)
                    
                    </code>
                    </pre>

        
                <p>One key part of the YOLOv3 loss is the <strong>XY Loss</strong>, which focuses on predicting the x-coordinate and y-coordinate of bounding boxes. This loss ensures that the predicted coordinates align as closely as possible with the true positions of objects. When the model minimizes this loss, it becomes better at pinpointing the exact locations of objects in an image.</p>

                <p>By refining the XY Loss, the model learns to predict bounding boxes that accurately match the position of objects, leading to precise detections. Here's a snippet of the code that handles the calculation:</p>
                
                <pre>
                <code>
                    true_xy = xy_offset  # These are your true x_offset and y_offset within the cell
                    pred_xy = pred_box[..., :2]  # Predicted xy (already transformed via sigmoid) -> box_xy = tf.sigmoid(box_xy)
                    

                    tf.reduce_sum(tf.square(true_xy - pred_xy), axis=-1)
                </code>
                </pre>
                
                <p>This code calculates the difference between the true and predicted width/height values. Using logarithmic transformation helps scale the bounding box dimensions, making the loss calculation more stable. The sum of squared differences measures how closely the predicted box matches the actual size, guiding the model to improve its accuracy.</p>
                

                <p>Another crucial part of the YOLOv3 loss is the <strong>Objectness (Obj) Loss</strong>. This loss helps the model determine whether an object is present in a particular grid cell. Essentially, it measures how confident the model is about detecting an object in that area.</p>

                <p>The Objectness Loss is calculated using a binary cross-entropy loss, comparing the predicted confidence score to the actual presence or absence of an object. A lower loss means the model is better at identifying whether a grid cell contains an object, leading to fewer false positives and false negatives.</p>

                <p>Here's how the Objectness Loss calculation looks in code:</p>

                <pre>
                <code>
                    iou_scores = iou_loss(targets[..., :6], bbox)
        
        
                    adjusted_objectness = tf.squeeze(objectness) * iou_scores

                    obj_loss_old = self.compute_objectness_loss(obj_mask, tf.squeeze(objectness, axis=-1)) # This only calculates Binary_crossentropy
                </code>
                </pre>

                <p>In this code, the objectness mask (<code>object_mask</code>) tells the model which cells contain objects and which do not. By applying binary cross-entropy, we encourage the model to give high confidence scores when objects are present and low scores when they aren't.</p>

                <p>Minimizing this loss helps the model become more precise, ensuring that it doesn’t detect objects where there aren’t any and improves the overall accuracy of the detection.</p>
